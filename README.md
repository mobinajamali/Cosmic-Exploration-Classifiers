# Cosmic Exploration Classifiers
### About:
This project is a data-driven exploration of the cosmos through analyzing the [SDSS](https://www.sdss.org/) large-scale astronomical survey to explore and classify celestial objects based on their properties. To facilitate the analysis, I performed all my work on [SciServer](https://apps.sciserver.org/dashboard/) cloud-based computing system that offers an extensive range of interconnected tools and services.

For the classification of celestial objects, I deployed three distinct ML models: k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and a Neural Network (MLP Classifier). Each model underwent meticulous fine-tuning, incorporating various regularization techniques and hyperparameter selections to maximize accuracy and dependability.
